\section{User side}

The client can download the software locally ( directly from the GSLS) from GitHub or wherever is hosted).
In this case is on Electron application running Nodejs on the backend side and React on the front side, where is possible to login uploading the wallet file and the password ( is it still needed?).
This information is needed to create the row transaction before sending it to the GSLS server.

The User can create a new social record or change an existing one ( of course only if he is allowed to ).
When the user click on the “submit” Button the following operations are performed:

- Convert the address of the receiver ( the contract in this case) . Tu Lux.
- Get the Gas price; the gas price is changing constantly in order to set it, it is required to run a get HTTP request to the GSLS server.
- Gas Limit: the maximum amount of Gas that the user wants to spend for the transaction to flex.
