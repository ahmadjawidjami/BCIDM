\section{Directory Service}
Also known as name service, maps the names of network resources to their respective network addresses. Each resource on the network is considered an object by the directory server. Information about a particular resource is stored as a collection of attributes associated with that resource or object. One of the most representing example is the DNS, which offers internet domain names translation to ip addresses.

\section{DHT and P2P Networks}
A distributed hash table (DHT) is a class of a decentralised distributed system that provides a lookup service similar to a hash table: (key, value) pairs are stored in a DHT, and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key

\subsection{DHT characteristics}
\begin{list}{}{}
\item \emph{Autonomy and decentralization}: multiple nodes, no central coordinator;
\item \emph{Fault tolerance}: reliable, no single point of failure (like Napster’s central server) (Byzantine fault tolerance);
\item \emph{Scalability}: the system scales. This means it’s working efficiently regardless the workload; 
\item \emph{Load balancing} (optional);
\item \emph{Data integrity} (optional).
\end{list}  

\subsection{Functioning Example}
Once these components are in place, a typical use of the DHT for storage and retrieval might proceed as follows. Suppose the keyspace is the set of 160-bit strings. To index a file with given filename and data in the DHT, the SHA-1 hash of filename is generated, producing a 160-bit key k, and a message put(k, data) is sent to any node participating in the DHT. The message is forwarded from node to node through the overlay network until it reaches the single node responsible for key k as specified by the keyspace partitioning. That node then stores the key and the data. Any other client can then retrieve the contents of the file by again hashing filename to produce k and asking any DHT node to find the data associated with k with a message get(k). The message will again be routed through the overlay to the node responsible for k, which will reply with the stored data.

\subsection{The Network}
Each node maintains a set of links to other nodes (its neighbors or routing table). Together, these links form the overlay network. A node picks its neighbors according to a certain structure, called the network's topology.

Aside from routing, there exist many algorithms that exploit the structure of the overlay network for sending a message to all nodes, or a subset of nodes, in a DHT. These algorithms are used by applications to do overlay multicast, range queries, or to collect statistic. (Flooding).

\section{Blockchain Implementations}
\subsection*{Blockchain introduction}
Blockchain’s distributed ledger system is used to keep track of Bitcoin transactions. Blockchain eliminates the need for central authorities and enables each user of the system to maintain their own copy of the ledger. It also keeps all copies of the ledger synchronized through a consensus algorithm.Bitcoin miners do the recording and validation of the transactions. The miners are necessary to prevent ‘double spend.’
\subsection*{Bitcoin}
Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology used to keep track of Bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions. Distributed ledgers create a data structure – like a chain – where records of every single Bitcoin transaction live. To prevent “double spend,” all Bitcoin transactions are validated and then permanently archived in the cryptographic ledger or chain. The validation is done via a peer-to-peer process that is hugely computer-intensive. It is supported by a global network of volunteers – known as “miners” – who are incentivized mainly by Bitcoin’s mining reward.
In essence, Bitcoin uses cryptography to enable participants on the network to update the ledger in a secure way without the need for a central authority. The key to Blockchain was to agree on the order of entries in the ledger. Once this was in place, distributed control of Bitcoin was possible.

\subsection*{Namecoin}
Namecoin is an experimental open-source technology which improves decentralization, security, censorship resistance, privacy, and speed of certain components of the Internet infrastructure such as DNS and identities. Namecoin is a key/value pair registration and transfer system based on the Bitcoin technology.
What does Namecoin do under the hood?
\begin{list}{}{}
\item Securely record and transfer arbitrary names (keys).
\item Attach a value (data) to the names (up to 520 bytes).
\item Transact the digital currency namecoins (NMC).
\item Like bitcoins, Namecoin names are difficult to censor or seize.
\item Lookups do not generate network traffic (improves privacy).
\end{list}

\subsection*{Hyperledger / Hyperledger Fabric}
Hyperledger is an open source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies. It is a global collaboration, hosted by The Linux Foundation, including leaders in finance, banking, Internet of Things, supply chains, manufacturing and Technology.
Hyperledger Fabric is a business blockchain framework hosted on Hyperledger intended as a foundation for developing blockchain applications or solutions with a modular architecture. Hyperledger Fabric allows components such as consensus and membership services to be plug-and-play.
Hyperledger Fabric establishes trust, transparency, and accountability based on the following principles:
\begin{list}{}{}
\item Permissioned network - Provides collectively defined membership and access rights within your business network
\item Confidential transactions - Gives businesses the flexibility and security to make transactions visible to select parties with the correct encryption keys
\item No cryptocurrency - Does not require mining and expensive computations to assure transactions
\item Programmable - Leverage the embedded logic in smart contracts to automate business processes across your network
\end{list}

\subsection*{Ehtereum}
Ethereum is a  decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.
These apps run on a custom built  blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property. This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middle man or counterparty risk.
On traditional server architectures, every application has to set up its own servers that run their own code in isolated silos, making sharing of data hard. If a single app is compromised or goes offline, many users and other apps are affected.
On a blockchain, anyone can set up a node that replicates the necessary data for all nodes to reach an agreement and be compensated by users and app developers. This allows user data to remain private and apps to be decentralized like the Internet was supposed to work.
\subsection*{Storj}
Storj is a peer-to-peer cloud storage network implementing client-side encryption would allow users to transfer and share data without reliance on a third party storage provider. The removal of central controls would mitigate most traditional data failures and outages, as well as significantly increase security, privacy, and data control. Peer-to-peer networks are generally unfeasible for production storage systems, as data availability is a function of popularity, rather than utility.
\subsection*{Swarm}
Swarm is a distributed storage platform and content distribution service, a native base layer service of the ethereum web 3 stack. The primary objective of Swarm is to provide a decentralized and redundant store of Ethereum's public record, in particular to store and distribute dapp code and data as well as block chain data. 
From the end user's perspective, Swarm is not that different from WWW, except that uploads are not to a specific server. The objective is to peer-to-peer storage and serving solution that is DDOS-resistant, zero-downtime, fault-tolerant and censorship-resistant as well as self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system which uses peer to peer accounting and allows trading resources for payment. Swarm is designed to deeply integrate with the devp2p multiprotocol network layer of Ethereum as well as with the Ethereum blockchain for domain name resolution, service payments and content availability insurance.
\subsection*{IPFS}
The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with contentaddressed hyper links. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG, a data structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web. IPFS combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.
\subsection*{Filecoin}
Filecoin is a distributed electronic currency similar to Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin’s computation-only proof-of-work, Filecoin’s proof-of-work function includes a proof-of-retrievability component, which requires nodes to prove they store a particular file. The Filecoin network forms an entirely distributed file sorage system, whose nodes are incentivized to store as much of the entire network’s data as they can. The currency is awarded for storing files, and is transferred in transactions, as in Bitcoin. Files are added to the network by spending currency. This produces strong monetary incentives for individuals to join and work for the network. In the course of ordinary operation of the Filecoin network, nodes contribute useful work in the form of storage and distribution of valuable data.
\section{Blockstack Use Case}
\section{How to Store Social Records}
\subsection{Solution 1}
Store the Social Record directly in the data field of a transaction. 
Then the problems are: 

\begin{list}{}{}
\item How do I retrieve the social record?
\item Every time i update the social record, the transaction address changes
\item Storing an entire social record costs more gas than storing only its hash.
\item How should the social record be stored? Only one contract with all the Social Records inside? But then other problems arise like: the gas cost per each operation, the necessity to build a data structure inside the contract losing all the good properties provided by the blockchain. Then the data field space is only about 44KB.
\item If you use one transaction per Social Record, then you have to search through the entire blockchain, looking inside the transaction tree starting from the merkel root per each block. Not that efficient. 
\end{list}

\subsection{Solution 2}
This solution is inspired by Blockstack architecture and requires to create a DHT to map the GlobalID to the address of the transaction contained inside the blockchain. 

The transaction holds in the data field the hash of the Social Record. In this manner, the blockchain has the role of validation infrastructure rather than storage system. The actual data is stored in the distributed hash table. This solution could be vulnerable in case a malicious node tries to restore an old version of the social record by injecting the wrong address in the DHT table and causing a wrong mapping. 

Another vulnerability could be in the consistency of the data, some node could be inconsistent id the DHT doesn’t get updated. Therefore, the version control should be handled by the blockchain. Most of the vulnerabilities depend on the fact that a transaction stored in the blockchain has a different address every time we update the information contained within the Social Record. 

\subsection{Solution 3}
The third solution is based on the second one but requires each user to hold an Ethereum Wallet. In such design each transaction contains both the Wallet public key and the hash of the Social Record within the data field. Every time the Social Record gets updated, its hash changes and the new transaction will have a different address. 

The idea is to use the wallet public key as id, and map the GlobalID with the Wallet ID which will remain always the same. Searching inside the blockchain looking for the ID, the ledger will return the latest version. Compared to the second solution, the former provide version check through the blockchain rather than DHT. 

\section{Security}
\subsection{Elliptic Curves}
ECC is the next generation of public key cryptography, and based on currently understood mathematics, it provides a significantly more secure foundation than first-generation public key cryptography systems like RSA. 

With ECC, you can use smaller keys to get the same levels of security. Small keys are important, especially in a world where more and more cryptography is done on less powerful devices like mobile phones. While multiplying two prime numbers together is easier than factoring the product into its component parts, when the prime numbers start to get very long, even just the multiplication step can take some time on a low powered device. While you could likely continue to keep RSA secure by increasing the key length, that comes with a cost of slower cryptographic performance on the client. ECC appears to offer a better tradeoff: high security with short, fast keys.
